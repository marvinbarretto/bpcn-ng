# BpcnNg

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.12.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

# Commit & Versioning Workflow

This project uses **Conventional Commits** and **standard-version** to automate versioning and changelog generation. Optionally, **Husky** is used for commit hooks to enforce rules locally.

## âœ… Commit Style

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Examples:

- `feat: add footer component`
- `fix(home): correct nav focus state`
- `chore: update dependencies`
- `docs: add README section on versioning`

Types include: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `style`, `test`.

### ðŸ”º Triggering Version Bumps

By default, `standard-version` analyzes commit messages and bumps semver accordingly:

- `fix:` â†’ Patch
- `feat:` â†’ Minor
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` (in body or footer) â†’ Major

To trigger a **major** version bump, include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit body or footer:

```
feat: overhaul API surface

BREAKING CHANGE: removed deprecated endpoints
```

> ðŸ”’ The format isn't strictly enforced by default â€” you can opt in using Husky + commitlint.

## ðŸ›  Scripts

### Bump version + update changelog (manual)

```
npm run release
```

This will:

- Analyze commits since the last release
- Bump version in `package.json`
- Generate/append to `CHANGELOG.md`
- Commit the release as `chore(release): x.y.z`
- Create a Git tag `vX.Y.Z`

### Push release (manual)

After running `npm run release`, push the tag and release commit:

```
git push && git push --tags
```

### Auto-release via CI (optional)

If you're using GitHub Actions or Railway builds, you can set up CI to:

- Run `npm run release` after merging to `master`
- Push the tag and changelog

> This gives you full control â€” manual local bumps or automated CI releases.

## ðŸ§ª Tooling

### `standard-version`
Used for changelog + semantic versioning.

```
npm install --save-dev standard-version
```

Add to `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
  "release": "standard-version"
}
```

### `husky` (optional)
To enforce commit rules locally before they enter the repo.

```
npm install --save-dev husky
npx husky install
```

Add to `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
  "prepare": "husky install"
}
```

Then manually create the hook:

```bash
mkdir -p .husky
cat <<'EOF' > .husky/commit-msg
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npx --no -- commitlint --edit "$1"
EOF
chmod +x .husky/commit-msg
```

### `commitlint` (optional)
To validate conventional commits:

```
npm install --save-dev @commitlint/{cli,config-conventional}
```

Add to `package.json`:
```json
"commitlint": {
  "extends": ["@commitlint/config-conventional"]
}
```

## ðŸ”– Branching

- Work in feature branches locally
- Merge to `master` to trigger Railway build and optional version bump

No need for PRs unless working with others.

## ðŸ“„ Files created
- `CHANGELOG.md`: auto-managed by `standard-version`
- `.husky/`: optional git hooks

You're now ready to commit cleanly, bump semver, and ship like a pro.





`--release-as` flag to override the version bump:

```bash
npm run release -- --release-as 1.0.0
```
or
```bash
npm run release -- --release-as major
```


- Do your work locally.
- Commit with a proper prefix:

feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, etc.

Add BREAKING CHANGE: if needed.

- Run `npm run release` when youâ€™re ready.

- Push with:

```bash
git push && git push --tags
```
